EU MRV Emissions Analytics

This repository provides tools and scripts to process the EU MRV (Monitoring, Reporting and Verification) emissions datasets published by EMSA.
The goal is to extract, analyze, and visualize annual CO₂ emissions for ships operating in European waters (2018–2024).

📌 Overview
--------------------
Process official EMSA MRV Excel files (2018–2024).

Compute annual total CO₂ emissions across all reported ships.

Save results in clean CSV format for reproducibility.

Generate publication-quality visualizations for academic papers.

Designed with large-scale Excel handling in mind (memory-efficient).

⚙️ Installation
-------------------

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/EU-MRV-Analytics.git
cd EU-MRV-Analytics


Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

▶️ Usage
------------------------

Place your EMSA MRV Excel files (2018–2024) into the data/ folder.
Example filenames:

2018-v272-05072025-EU MRV Publication of information.xlsx

2019-v227-28052025-EU MRV Publication of information.xlsx

...

2024-v55-30082025-EU MRV Publication of information.xlsx

Run the analysis script:
------------------------

python scripts/compute_mrv_co2.py


Check the results/ folder for:

EU_MRV_CO2_Totals.csv → clean CSV file with Year & Total Emissions.

EU_MRV_CO2_Trends.png → line chart of annual emissions.

📊 Example Output
----------------------

Console:

Processing 2018 ...
  ✔ 2018: 145.35 Mt CO₂
Processing 2019 ...
  ✔ 2019: 141.20 Mt CO₂
...
Results saved to:
  - results/EU_MRV_CO2_Totals.csv
  - results/EU_MRV_CO2_Trends.png
