# EU MRV Emissions Analytics

This repository provides tools and scripts to process the **EU MRV (Monitoring, Reporting and Verification)** emissions datasets published by EMSA.  
The goal is to extract, analyze, and visualize **annual CO‚ÇÇ emissions** for ships operating in European waters (2018‚Äì2024).

---

## Overview
- Process official EMSA MRV Excel files (2018‚Äì2024).
- Compute **annual total CO‚ÇÇ emissions** across all reported ships.
- Save results in clean CSV format for reproducibility.
- Generate publication-quality visualizations for academic papers.
- Designed with **large-scale Excel handling** in mind (memory-efficient).
